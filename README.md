## üìä Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, customer churn (i.e., customers leaving the service) can significantly impact revenue. The goal of this project is to **predict whether a customer will churn**, based on their usage patterns and service plans.

---

## üí° Approach

### 1. Data Understanding & EDA
- Loaded and explored the dataset (`train.csv`)
- Visualized churn distribution
- Created bar plots and boxplots to analyze relationships between features and churn
- Identified imbalance in the target class (`churn`)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical variables (`yes`/`no`) to numeric (0/1)
- Dropped irrelevant features like `state` and `area_code`
- Checked and handled missing values
- Performed **train-test split** (80/20)

### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data
- Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (`churn = 1`)

### 4. Model Training
- Trained and evaluated two models:
  - **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
  - **Random Forest Classifier** (improved accuracy and recall)

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score (Classification Report)
- Observed significant performance improvement using Random Forest + SMOTE

## üìà Results

| Model              | Accuracy | Precision (1) | Recall (1) | F1-Score (1) |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression (SMOTE) | ~73%     | ~0.32         | ~0.74      | ~0.45        |
| Random Forest (SMOTE)       | **Higher**    | **Better balance** | **Improved**  | **Stronger**    |

- The Random Forest model gave better results in handling class imbalance.
- Performance metrics suggest improved **recall** for churners, which is critical in business scenarios.
